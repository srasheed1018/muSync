# muSync
MuSync is a music management system that allows users to enter YouTube URLs to form a library of music. 
From this library, users are able to create playlists and play their favorite tracks on demand. 

This was a project I worked on as part of my CUS1166 Software Engineering course. 
It was created using Java, with Swing for a graphical user interface, as well as JDBC and Postgresql for database management.
